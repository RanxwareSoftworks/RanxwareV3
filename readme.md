# Ranxware is Discontinued

During early January 2025, Ranxware V3 was currently being in development. But since most executors aren't affordable and the Byfron anticheat is making exploiting
a huge struggle, I have to unfortunately announce that this massive project has been cancelled.

Ever since its start in 2023, I had lots of fun making this complex utility for uesrs to enjoy. But ever since Byfron has released, it prevented me from
just maintaining the script itself. After some constant breaks, procrastination, and having to deal with my real life issues, Ranxware just doesn't seem like it
can come back at this point.

This upcoming repository is now archived and will potentially no longer be redeveloped ever.

As always, have a good day...
